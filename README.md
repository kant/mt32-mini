# MT-32 Mini

This project aims to provide CAD drawings and materials to a faithful reproduction of the [Roland MT-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32) MIDI synthesizer in a 3D printable miniature scale.

The intention is to use the case with the [mt32-pi project](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi) for a complete retro gaming experience.

The project has started as a response to the lack of MT-32 synths available *in the wild* as well as the increasing price of the original vintage synth hardware.
